### About The Project
This project is a case study which focuses on the requirements for a system that the author has called the Mentcare system, which is a real system (although that is not its real name) which was used in a number of UK hospitals, including hospitals in Scotland. Our job is to design a system for use in clinics attended by patients suffering from mental health problems and records details of their consultations and conditions. It is separate from a more general patient records system as more detailed information has to be maintained and the system has to be set up to generate letters and reports of different types and to help ensure that the laws pertaining to mental health are maintained by staff treating patients. For more information on this case study visit the [Mentcare: A mental health support system](https://software-engineering-book.com/case-studies/mentcare/) case study.
